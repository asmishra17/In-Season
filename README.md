# In-Season
Project #1 

## Objective
A weather and event based app that displays not only event suggestions given user's location, but also outfit suggestions given weather conditions and event type user has selected. 

## Why do I need to stay/dress *In Season*? 
Weather is such an unpredictable thing. It could be 60&deg;F when you head out in the dead of winter and drop down to 10&deg;F by the time you get back home. Knowing all this, dressing for the weather is like a big game of chance especially during flu season. With *In Season*, we aim to take away the stress of what to wear and make sure you are dressed for the Season. 

## Looking Forward
* Right now, our focus is on a female target audience. Moving forward, we want to take into account men and menwsear.
* *ASOS API* - In the future, we would like to utilize a clothing API (like ASOS API), in order to display clothing suggestions that user can buy without searching where to buy it from. 
* *Google Analytics* -  We want to be able to suggest recommendations for the user given user's stored data (types of events he/she has gone to, location/zip/searched locations, as well as outfits bought) from Firebase. 
* Add a calendar, and lookforwards, so that the user can dress for the whole week, or look up for a future specific date. (Eg scenario: dressing for a wedding.)
